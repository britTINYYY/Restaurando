# Restaurando
Make School Final Project, built in Swift, intended to help with indecisiveness; 
1. The app will generate a random type of food/restaurant
2. The user will select the distance they are willing to travel
3. Using the Yelp API, there will be up to 5 restaurants that the user can choose from
